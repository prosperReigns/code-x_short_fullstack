## conditionals

**0-main.py**
Write a Python program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiples of 5, between 1500 and 2700 (both included).

**1-main.py**
Write a Python program to convert temperatures to and from Celsius and Fahrenheit.
( Formula : c/5 = f-32/9 [ where c = temperature in celsius and f = temperature in fahrenheit ])
Expected Output :
60°C is 140 in Fahrenheit
45°F is 7 in Celsius

**2-main.py**
Write a Python program to guess a number between 1 and 9.
Note : User is prompted to enter a guess. If the user guesses wrong then the prompt appears again until the guess is correct, on successful guess, user will get a "Well guessed!" message, and the program will exit.

**3-main.py**
Write a Python program that accepts a word from the user and reverses it.

**4-main.py**
Write a Python program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6.
Note : Use 'continue' statement.
Expected Output : 0 1 2 4 5

**5-main.py**
Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 and 50.
Note : The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers :
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ....
Every next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.
Expected Output : 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34

**6-main.py**
Write a Python program that iterates the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of three and five, print "FizzBuzz".
Sample Output :
fizzbuzz
1
2
fizz
4
buzz

**7-main.py**
Write a Python program that takes two digits m (row) and n (column) as input and generates a two-dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j.
Note :
i = 0,1.., m-1
j = 0,1, n-1.
Test Data : Rows = 3, Columns = 4
Expected Result : [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3], [0, 2, 4, 6]]

**8-main.py**
Write a Python program that accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers as its input. The program will print the numbers that are divisible by 5 in a comma separated sequence.
Sample Data : 0100,0011,1010,1001,1100,1001
Expected Output : 1010

**9-main.py**
 Write a Python program to sum two integers. However, if the sum is between 15 and 20 it will return 20.

**10-main.py**
Write a Python program to check if a triangle is equilateral, isosceles or scalene.
Note :
An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are equal.
A scalene triangle is a triangle that has three unequal sides.
An isosceles triangle is a triangle with (at least) two equal sides.
Expected Output:

Input lengths of the triangle sides:
x: 6
y: 8
z: 12
Scalene triangle

## functions

**1-func.py**
Write a Python function to find the maximum of three numbers.

**2-func.py**
Write a Python program to reverse a string.
Sample String : "1234abcd"
Expected Output : "dcba4321"

**3-func.py**
Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number (a non-negative integer). The function accepts the number as an argument.

**4-func.py**
Write a Python function that takes a list and returns a new list with distinct elements from the first list.
Sample List : [1,2,3,3,3,3,4,5]
Unique List : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

**5-func.py**
Write a Python program that accepts a hyphen-separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a hyphen-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.
Sample Items : green-red-yellow-black-white
Expected Result : black-green-red-white-yellow

**6-func.py**
Write a Python function to create and print a list where the values are the squares of numbers between 1 and 30 (both included).

**7-func.py**
Write a Python program to access a function inside a function.

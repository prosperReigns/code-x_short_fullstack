Cloning a Git repository and working locally

1. Configure Git command line and editor if you haven’t done that already.

2. Decide which repository you want to clone: your fork or the original repository? Both will work for this exercise. Then, clone the recipe book.

3. Create a new branch.

4. Make a commit on your new branch.

5. Switch back to the main branch and create one or two commits there.

6. Merge the new branch into main.

7. Compare the graph locally and on GitHub and observe that the changes only exist locally on your computer.

8. Where are the remote branches? Practice how you can see all remote branches also locally and how you can fetch them and make local changes to them.
